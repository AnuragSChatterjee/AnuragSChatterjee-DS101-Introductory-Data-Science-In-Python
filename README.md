# AnuragSChatterjee-DS101-Introductory-Data-Science-In-Python

I completed a two-week exploratory Data Science project on Airbnb Data using Python on September 2019 as a requirement for Hackwagon Academy's Introduction to Data Science and Python programming course, DS101. The main aim of this project was to use python algorithms and libraries to analyze and mine the reviews people have actually submitted on Singapore Airbnb rentals in 2017 in order to provide descriptive analytics and perform visualizations. This would help us generate better insights on customer data gathered.
